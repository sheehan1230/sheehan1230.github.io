","Normally, human cells grow and multiply to form new cells as the body needs them.","Such a cell may be considered as a cancer cell, and a mass of cancer cells may form a tumor.",d
LEpTTolebqo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEpTTolebqo,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Future Prediction,What will happen if the cancer cells penatrate into the circulatory system?,Cancer cells rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells.,Cancer cells ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die.,Cancer cells grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals. ,The cancer cell will colonize in other parts of the body and cause cancer or tumor in other organs.,d
LEpTTolebqo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEpTTolebqo,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Domain Expertise,What makes cancer cells different from regular cells?,Cancer cells tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.  These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.,Cancer cells trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow.,"Regular cells grow and die and are replaced in a controlled way, while cancer cells continue to grow and divide.",Cancer cells hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells. ,c

hGDvvUNU-cw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGDvvUNU-cw,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Explanation,Why the neurons use two types of signals to communicate?,Nerve cells communicate via a combination of electrical and chemical signals. ,Hundreds of molecules are known to act as neurotransmitters in the brain.,"The message starts as electrical signals, but the electrical signals cannot cross the gap between neurons. Therefore, the electrical signals are converted into chemical signals, which can cross the gap between neurons.",The neurotransmitter molecules bind to the receptor proteins and alter postsynaptic neuronal function. ,c
hGDvvUNU-cw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGDvvUNU-cw,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Counterfactual Thinking,What would happen if the neuron does not want to pass on the message from the previous neuron?,Individual neurons usually are completely separated from one another by their outer cell membranes and thus cannot directly share electrical or chemical signals.,"The actions of alcohol on synaptic transmission also contribute to alcohol-seeking behavior, excessive drinking, and alcoholism.",Neuronal development and function also are affected by peptides known as neurotrophins and by steroid hormones.,"In this case, the synapse will quiet the message.",d
hGDvvUNU-cw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGDvvUNU-cw,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Future Prediction,How will the repeated activities change the neuron and synapse?,"Repeated activities will strengthen the synapse, which will make the neuron more likely to pass on the message. Neurons will learn to pass on important messages and ignore unimportant ones.",Adjacent sections of axon in a given neuron are each surrounded by a distinct myelin sheath.,"Between signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.","Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge.",a
hGDvvUNU-cw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGDvvUNU-cw,Health & Medicine,Basic Medical Science,Domain Expertise,How does the message travel from one neuron to another?,The information is transformed from an action potential to chemical message to pass through the synapse and trigger an action potential in the neuron on the other side.,Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders.,Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.,"From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal, and its state changes abruptly.",a
